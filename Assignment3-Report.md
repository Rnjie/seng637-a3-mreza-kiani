# 1 Introduction

Text…

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

Text…

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

For reaching to more than 90% in line coverage, we wanted to do 2 things: 
1. Add new test cases for previous methods that didn't have 100% line coverage.
2. Add test cases for new methods to make them have 100% line coverage.



# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Text…

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

Text…

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

Text…

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

Text…

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

Text…

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

Text…

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself
